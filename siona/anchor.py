"""siona.anchor — the cross-lingual glyph→CONCEPT anchor (F1141): the missing bottom-up layer (F1140).

Our meaning stack is English-surface-anchored — FORM (byte-cognate), RELATIONAL (`relate`, English co-occurrence),
CHIRALITY (`chirality`, English antonyms) — so a NON-COGNATE / logographic language blinds every axis (F1140). The
fix is a language-independent glyph→CONCEPT anchor: for a logographic script the FORM axis is NOT bytes, it is the
glyph→concept LEXICON (F1128 — a glyph IS a concept, bit-exact op(x)operand). This module loads such an anchor
(Egyptian Vygus dictionary — the tractable model; the Sumerian analog is the ePSD, not yet on disk) and bridges a
source unit to English CONCEPTS, on which the RELATIONAL + CHIRALITY axes then operate.

So the pipeline for a non-cognate language: glyph → CONCEPT (this anchor = the FORM axis) → the English-anchored
RELATIONAL/CHIRALITY reasoning. The anchor is the bottom layer the k=3 spread regime (F1131) needs where no
perspective otherwise has signal.

sparse (a lexicon dict), numpy-free. Attested to the Vygus 2018 Middle Egyptian dictionary (`vygus_dict_slice`).
